# Comprehensive Exploration of Diverse Datasets Leveraging ChatGPT-4

## Objective
The primary goal of this study is to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preparation, and processing of a selection of popular Kaggle datasets. These datasets span a range of data types, including tabular, timeseries, spatio-temporal, image, audio, video, and graph data. With a combination of automated tools like AutoML platforms and the assistance of ChatGPT-4, this exploration aims to highlight the synergy between human expertise and automation in data science.

## Datasets Studied

1. **Tabular**: NYC Taxi Dataset
2. **Timeseries**: [To be filled after analysis]
3. **Spatio-temporal**: [To be filled after analysis]
4. **Image**: Fashion MNIST
5. **Audio**: Cats vs. Dogs Sound Classification
6. **Video**: UCF50 Action Recognition
7. **Graph**: Cisco Networks

## Workflow

For each dataset, the following procedures were applied:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and other necessary preprocessing steps.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features from the existing data.
- **Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models using both traditional and AutoML methods.
- **Documentation**: Writing detailed findings, insights, and experiences, culminating in a comprehensive Medium article.

## Articles

Our findings, methodologies, and experiences leveraging ChatGPT-4 have been documented in a series of Medium articles.
