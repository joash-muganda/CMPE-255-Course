## Introduction

Harnessing the power of both human intuition and automated tools can lead to richer insights in data science. In this repository, we demonstrate this synergy using the Smoking dataset.

## Dataset Description

The Smoking dataset consists of various features that provide insights into the smoking habits of individuals and associated health metrics.

## Setup and Data Loading

The dataset was loaded and initial setups were made using Python. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy were instrumental in this phase.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Missing Value Analysis
- Distribution Analysis
- Correlation Analysis

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- Categorical Encoding
- Feature Scaling
- Anomaly Detection

## Traditional Machine Learning

Before diving into AutoML, we employed traditional machine learning algorithms to establish baseline models.

## Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

We utilized H2O's AutoML for an efficient and automated model selection and tuning process.

## Clustering with K-means

The K-means algorithm from H2O was employed for unsupervised learning to segment our data.

## Results and Insights

This section showcases the interpretations and insights derived from our models.

## Conclusion

Our study underscores the immense potential of blending manual data science techniques with automated tools for enhanced model performance and insights.
