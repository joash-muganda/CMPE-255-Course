## 📊 Study Highlights

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the dataset showcasing the growth and evolution of the U.S. economy.
2. **Time Series Decomposition**: Breakdown of the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
3. **Forecasting with ARIMA**: Leveraging the ARIMA model to predict future GDP per capita values.
4. **K-means Clustering**: Segmentation of years based on their GDP growth rates.
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of years with unusual growth rates using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
6. **AutoML with TPOT**: Automated machine learning to identify an optimal forecasting model.
