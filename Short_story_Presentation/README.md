# Black-Box Prompt Optimization in AI Alignment

This repository is dedicated to the research and development of Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) and its application in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intentions, as outlined in our research paper and various media resources.

## Overview

Our work focuses on the innovative approach of BPO in AI, a method that holds great promise for the future of AI alignment. This method allows for more effective and efficient alignment of LLMs with specific human intentions without the need for extensive model retraining.
