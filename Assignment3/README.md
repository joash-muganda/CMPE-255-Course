# Analysis of Datasets Using CRISP-DM, KDD, and SEMMA Methodologies

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of different datasets utilizing three renowned data mining methodologies: CRISP-DM, KDD, and SEMMA. Each methodology is meticulously applied, ensuring a thorough understanding of the data at hand and extracting valuable insights.

## Overview

- **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**: An industry-proven approach to guide data mining efforts. This methodology has been applied to a specific dataset, ensuring each stage, from understanding the business to deployment, is methodically covered.
  
- **KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)**: A comprehensive process that emphasizes the high-level application of particular data mining methods. The stages of the KDD process have been followed rigorously, making sure every detail is considered.
  
- **SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess)**: Developed by SAS, this methodology is focused on creating quality predictive models. By leveraging SAS tools, each step from sampling data to assessing models is elaborated upon in detail.

## Features

1. **In-depth Analysis**: Every methodology is applied thoroughly, ensuring each stage and its subtasks are detailed and expansive.
   
2. **Detailed Reports**: Each project is accompanied by a comprehensive report that explains every step taken, the rationale behind decisions, and the insights obtained.
   
3. **Visualizations**: Rich visualizations are incorporated to offer a better understanding of the data and to elucidate the findings.
   
4. **Medium Articles**: For each project, a corresponding Medium article has been written, providing a narrative of the work done and insights gleaned.
   
5. **Research Papers**: Rigorous research papers in LaTeX format elucidate the methodologies, processes, and findings, ready for submission to platforms like arXiv.
