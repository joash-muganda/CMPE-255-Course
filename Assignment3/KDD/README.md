# Corruption Perception Index Analysis using the KDD Process

In this repository, we delve into an exploration of the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) using the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. Our goal is to uncover global and temporal patterns in corruption perceptions and their implications.

## Introduction
The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) is an annual ranking of countries based on the perceived level of public sector corruption. Our analysis goes beyond the ranking to discern patterns, trends, and clusters related to corruption perception.

## Data
The dataset comprises CPI scores for various countries spanning several years. You can view the dataset [here](https://github.com/joash-muganda/SJSU-FA23-CMPE-255-Data-Mining/blob/main/Assignment3/KDD/history.csv). <!-- Replace 'path_to_dataset.csv' with the path to your dataset -->

## Methodology
We employed the five-stage KDD process:
1. Selection
2. Preprocessing
3. Transformation
4. Data Mining
5. Interpretation/Evaluation

## Results
Our exploration revealed:
- Distribution of CPI scores across countries.
- Temporal trends in CPI scores.
- Clusters of countries with similar corruption perceptions.

## Conclusion
The CPI analysis using the KDD process provided valuable insights into global patterns of corruption perception. This understanding can guide policymakers and researchers in further explorations and reforms.

## Future Work
Further studies can delve deeper into:
- The causative factors behind high or low corruption perceptions.
- Long-term impacts of corruption on socio-economic growth.
- Integrating more datasets for a comprehensive perspective.
