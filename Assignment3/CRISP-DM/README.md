The dataset, titled "Heart Disease Cleveland UCI," was sourced from Kaggle. It comprises various medical indicators potentially influencing heart disease presence.

## Methods

### Data Pre-processing
The initial data underwent several preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling continuous variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
A thorough EDA was performed to understand the data's underlying patterns and distributions. Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps provided insights into potential relationships between features.
