# Vertex AI AutoML Project

This project demonstrates the use of Google Vertex AI for two different machine learning tasks: predicting movie ratings and forecasting daily temperatures in Melbourne.

## Movie Rating Prediction

### Overview
This section of the project focuses on building and deploying a model to predict movie ratings.

#### Process
- **Trained Model**: An image illustrates the details of the trained model.
- **Model Deployment**: Details of the deployment process are provided.
- **Model Test/Prediction**: An image shows the test or prediction phase of the model.
- **Evaluation Details**: Evaluation metrics and other relevant details are included.

## Predicting Daily Melbourne Temperatures

### Overview
Due to restrictions on using the Iowa Liquor sales dataset, this part of the project utilizes the Melbourne temperatures dataset for forecasting daily temperatures.

#### Process
- **Training Model**: Steps involved in training the model are outlined.
- **Trained Model**: A depiction of the trained model is provided.
- **Deployment**: Information on the deployment process, including an image indicating a deployment failure.

### Images
Images related to the project are included, providing visual insights into the models and processes used.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the capabilities of Google Vertex AI in handling diverse machine learning tasks, from entertainment to environmental data analysis.
