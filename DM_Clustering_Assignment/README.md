# Comprehensive Clustering Techniques Project

## Overview
This project encompasses a range of clustering techniques applied to various types of data. The objective is to demonstrate the implementation, analysis, and application of different clustering methods, each with its unique approach and utility.

## Clustering Techniques Covered
1. **K-Means Clustering from Scratch**: Implementing K-Means without using built-in libraries.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Using Python libraries to perform hierarchical clustering.
3. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) Clustering**: Applying GMM for clustering data.
4. **DBSCAN Clustering Using PyCaret**: Utilizing PyCaret to implement DBSCAN clustering.
5. **Anomaly Detection Using PyOD**: Demonstrating anomaly detection using PyOD.
6. **Clustering of Time Series Data Using Pretrained Models**: Applying clustering to time series data.
7. **Clustering of Documents Using LLM Embeddings**: Clustering documents based on state-of-the-art embeddings.
8. **Clustering with Images Using ImageBind LLM Embeddings**: Performing image clustering using ImageBind LLM.
9. **Audio Embeddings Using ImageBind LLMS**: Clustering audio files based on audio embeddings.

## Objectives
Each clustering method aims to:
- Showcase different approaches and algorithms.
- Analyze real-world or synthetic datasets.
- Provide insights and interpretations based on clustering results.

## Documentation
Each method includes detailed documentation covering:
- Implementation steps and rationale.
- Choice and impact of specific parameters or techniques.
- Comparative analysis with other clustering methods, where applicable.

## Datasets
Various datasets, both real-world and synthetic, are used to demonstrate the clustering techniques. These datasets are chosen to highlight the strengths and use cases of each method.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, PyCaret, PyOD, and other relevant Python packages.
